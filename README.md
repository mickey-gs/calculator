# calculator
A very simple command line calculator implemented with Ruby.

On running the script, an empty line will appear. Simply type in what you want to calculate and hit enter.

Supported operands:

  "+" => add

  "-" => subtract

  "*" => multiply

  "/" => divide

  "^" => raise to the power of

The calculator only supports integer operations at this time.

This is a basic project, mainly done to get back into using Ruby for bigger projects.
